## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### For Non-Developers (Static Version in `for-non-developers/`)

1. **Unzip** the template folder.
2. Upload the entire contents of the `for-non-developers/` folder to your web host or server.
   - After upload, visit your domain — the site should display correctly.
3. To preview locally:
   - Use a local server (e.g., right-click `index.html` in VS Code and select **"Open with Live Server"**).
   - ⚠️ Don’t double-click `index.html` directly — some features won’t work due to browser security rules.
4. You can edit text, images, and layout by opening `index.html` in a code editor.

> 🔧 Want to customize interactivity or layout more deeply? Use the Developer version below.
